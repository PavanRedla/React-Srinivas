<!-- 
Cookies:

Cookies data stored based on domain name.
We can see the cookie data in developer window(f12), application tab.
Data stored in the cookies, always in the form of key,value pairs.
The key is always unique
We have two type of cookies:
1) inmemory cookie
2) persistent cookie

Inmemory Cookie:

Inmemory cookie data is available only in the current browser(notlike sessionStorage available for one tab). Once browser closed, cookie data was gone.
Inmemory cookie data is available for all tabs in the browser for the same domain.
Ex: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script>
      document.cookie = "name=sachin";
      //Inserted sachin value with name as key in cookie.

      document.cookie = "name=dhoni";
      //alredy name key is there, so if key is already existed, it updates the value, if not it insert new one.

      document.cookie;
      //res : returns all the cookies in the browser for that domain name in the string format.

      document.cookie =
        "name=sachin;expires=Fri Apr 18 2019 17:09:12 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)";
      //If you observe above, you can find expires.If we give expires value before today date, then that cookie was removed.
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
<!--           
persistent Cookie:

If you want to store data in cookies for a particular amount of time, irrespective of tab closing or browser closing or system shutdown. Then we can go with persistent cookies.
We are using 'expires' key, to give the expiry date for cookie.
Ex: -->

<!-- <!DOCTYPE html>
          <html>
          <head>
            <script>
            document.cookie="name=sachin;expires=Fri Apr 5 2032 17:09:12 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)";
               //Inserted sachin value with name as key in cookie on the domain name, and it expires on Fri Apr 5 2032 17:09:12.

               //remaing all operations like update,retrive and delete, like Inmemory cookie.

               </script>
          </head>
          <body>
              
          </body>
          </html>
           -->
