<!-- Que 23:

Write code snippet, about closure ? -->

<!-- // Closure: // We can define closure like, the function(inner) with in the
function, and my inner function can access outer function variables,global
variables and own variables. // In Java Script, we can declare variable in local
or global. // If we declare the variable as gloabl, it may effected by others.
// So i don't want to expose my variable to out side, at the same time i want to
perform some operations on that variable. // Ex: -->

<!-- <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <script>
      var i = 1;
      function fnIncrement() {
        i = i + 1;
        console.log(i);
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <input type="button" value="Increment" onclick="fnIncrement()" />
  </body>
</html> -->

<!-- // If you observe above example, if you click on button, it increments i value and print that value in console.
 // But here we declare i as a global variable,so that there may be a chance, somebody can change that value. 
 // So I don't want to declare that variable as a gloable, want to make it as local. 
// If I declare that variable like local, not one can access from outside. -->

<!-- If you observe above example, we declare i variable as local Now if I click on
button, every time my i value reset to 1. So in my console always print 2 only.
But my requirement is increament value for each button click. So in the above
code var i=1; should have to execute only one time, and remaining statements
should have to execute for every button click. So for separation, we can keep
i=i+1;console.log(i) statements in one function, that function is an inner
function. -->

      function fnIncrement() {
        var i = 1;
        return function () {
          i = i + 1;
          console.log(i);
        };
      }
      var inc = fnIncrement();
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <input type="button" value="Increment" onclick="inc()" />
  </body>
</html>

<!-- If you observe above example, I creted one inner function, that can access outer
variable i. In that inner function I perform increment opartion and my outer
function return inner function. Now I call outer function on page load, So that
it execute var i=1; statement and it return inner function. I hold that return
inner function with one variable, and give that variable to my button click So
now am not expose my variable to out side and the same time i can perform some
opartion on that variable. So now we can define the closure like, the function
with in the function, and my inner function can access outer function
variables,global variables and own variables -->
