<!-- Can you create your own exception class ?
Write a sample code to throw the above exception using throw keyword. -->

<!-- throw:

throw is used to raise our own exceptions.
Some of the exeception are handled by Java Script by default and Some are we have to handle and raise our own exceptions using throw keyword. -->

<!--           
If you observe above example, we have sal variable with -100 value.
You know salary should not nagative. But my Java Script doesn't know, it just treat like sal is one variable.
In this case we have to handle and raise an exception.
So using throw keywork we can raise our own exceptions by passing exception message also.
Once my exception raised in try block, then corresponding catch block is exception with error message.There we provide some alternate solution like set the sal value to zero.
And then my finally block is going to executed.  -->

<script>
  function getRectArea(width, height) {
    if (isNaN(width) || isNaN(height)) {
      throw new Error("Parameter is not a number!");
    }
  }

  try {
    getRectArea(3, "A");
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
    // Expected output: Error: Parameter is not a number!
    console.log(e);
  }
</script>
