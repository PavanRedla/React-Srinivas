NVM:

NVM stands from Node Version Manager.

suppose you are using node js 16.2.0 version, but for some purpose you need to use node js 18.7.0 version. In that case you need to uninstall 16th version and install 18th version.

Instead of doing that using npm, we can use NVM to maintain two versions as shown below. By using NVM we can switch to the versions we need.

Before install nvm , uninstall node js s/w from your machine.
Install NVM s/w
Install specific version.

                  nvm install 16.2.0
                  nvm install 18.7.0

get all installed node versions

              nvm ls

              16.2.0
              18.7.0

Verify the current node version .

                  node -v

Swith one version to another version.

              nvm use 16.2.0

Uninstall specific node version

              nvm uninstall 16.2.0
