  <!-- 
 
Async VS Defer:

We are using aysnc and defer keywords as an attributes to script tag.
We used script tag to load a js file into html -->

  <!-- sample.js -->

  document.querySelector('div').innerHTML="Sachin"

  <!-- sample.html -->

  <h1>Sachin</h1>
  <script src="./sample.js"></script>
  <div></div>

  <!-- In the above example, if we run sample.html file, it thorws an error cann't read property innerHTML of null. Why because
while executing, document.querySelector('div').innerHTML="Sachin" statement, document.querySelector('div') return null value, why because at that time "div" element is not loaded.
We can load sample.js in below three ways: -->

  <!-- sample.js -->

  document.querySelector('div').innerHTML="Sachin"

  <!-- sample.html -->

  <h1>Sachin</h1>

  <!-- anyone of below script tag you can use -->

  <script src="./sample.js"></script>
  <script async src="./sample.js"></script>
  <script defer src="./sample.js"></script>

  <div></div>

  <!-- Without async or defer:
html file loaded into browser, browser load content line by line
h1 tag loaded, painted Sachin into browser.
Next loaded script tag, while loading script tag, it perform two operations, loading script file(sample.js),execute script(sample.js).
If there is no errors while executing script(sample.js), it loads the next line, 'div' tag.

async:

html file loaded into browser, browser load content line by line
h1 tag loaded, painted Sachin into browser.
Next loaded script tag with async attribute.
So both sample.js and html tags are loading parallelly.
Once sample.js loading completed , html loading stopped immediatly and started sample.js execution
Once sample.js execution completed,again resumes html tags loading(if any)

defer:

html file loaded into browser, browser execute content line by line
h1 tag loaded, painted Sachin into browser.
Next loaded script tag with defer attribute.
So both sample.js and html tags are loading parallelly.
Once all html tags loading completed , then only sample.js execution will start. -->
