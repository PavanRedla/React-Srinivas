to create a basic skelton of react js application, we have to use some commands.

we have the below frameworks which are built on top or React js to build the basic skelton of Reactjs Application

Among these popular one is Next.js

to use Next.js we need to setup the things

first one is we need to install node js in our system

check node is installed or not ?

open commandpropmpt and type

> node -v

not there - "node" is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
what we have to - install node s/w : https://nodejs.org/en/download - go to prebuilt installer and download LTS(long term support) verison. Double click the downloaded file and install it. now again check in cmd

if there - it gives version 18.7.0

or

> npm

second step: to create next js application we need to check "create-next-app" command is available or not.

cmd> create-next-app

there -

if not there - "create-next-app" is not recognized as an internal or external command,operable program or batch file.

what we have to do install it. By using npm we can install/make the command available

go to cmd and type - npm i -g create-next-app o/p: added 1 package in secs

i stands for install, g stands for global (system level)

===================
Now the setup is done

go to workspace folder and create New folder and open command propmt and type below command

> create-next-app <app-name>
