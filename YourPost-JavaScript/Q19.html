const players=[
             {
                 name:"Sachin",
                 runs:20000,
                 retiredOn:"03-10-2010"
             },
             {
                 name:"Pointing",
                 runs:16000,
                 retiredOn:"01-01-2015"
             },
             {
                 name:"Lara",
                 runs:19000,
                 retiredOn:"02-07-2005"
             }
            
         ]

Can you sort the above players on runs in ascending order ? 
output should be  Pointing, Lara, Sachin objects in the array -->

<script>
  const players = [
    {
      name: "Sachin",
      runs: 20000,
      retiredOn: "03-10-2010",
    },
    {
      name: "Pointing",
      runs: 16000,
      retiredOn: "01-01-2015",
    },
    {
      name: "Lara",
      runs: 19000,
      retiredOn: "02-07-2005",
    },
  ];

  players.sort((a, b) => {
    return a.runs - b.runs;
  });

  console.log(players);
</script>
