<!-- JavaScript:

var o1={
 “name”:"Sachin"
}
var o2=o1
o2.name="Dhoni"

Now o2 name property value is Dhoni as well as o1 name property value also get changed to Dhoni (you can check because of singleton behavior).

But as per my requirement  o1 value should not change to Dhnoi , should be Sachin only.

Can you write the code for that (at least 2 ways)

1st way:

……

2nd way:

…..

3rd way:

….

Hint: We can do it by creating cloned object for o2 like below

using Spread operator
using Object.assign()
using JSON.stringifyand JSON.parse methods -->

<script>
  var o1 = {
    name: "Sachin",
  };
  var o2 = Object.assign({}, o1);
  o2.name = "Dhoni";

  var o1 = {
    name: "Sachin",
  };
  var o2 = { ...o1 };
  o2.name = "Dhoni";
</script>
