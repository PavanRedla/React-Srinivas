              Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test
              match debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the
              age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and
              India internationally for over 24 years.[9] In 2002, halfway
              through his career, Wisden ranked him the second-greatest Test
              batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman, and the second-greatest
              ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards.[10] The same year,
              Tendulkar was a part of the team that was one of the joint-winners
              of the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy. Later in his career, Tendulkar
              was part of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket World Cup,
              his first win in six World Cup appearances for India.[11] He had
              previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 World
              Cup. Tendulkar has received several awards from the government of
              India: the Arjuna Award (1994), the Khel Ratna Award (1997), the
              Padma Shri (1998), and the Padma Vibhushan (2008).[12][13] After
              Tendulkar played his last match in November 2013, the Prime
              Minister's Office announced the decision to award him the Bharat
              Ratna, India's highest civilian award.[14][15] He was the first
              sportsperson to receive the reward and, as of 2023, is the
              youngest recipient.[16][17][18] In 2010, Time included Tendulkar
              in its annual list of the most influential people in the
              world.[19] Tendulkar was awarded the Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy
              for cricketer of the year at the 2010 International Cricket
              Council (ICC) Awards.[20] Having retired from ODI cricket in
              2012,[21][22] he retired from all forms of cricket in November
              2013 after playing his 200th Test match.[23] Tendulkar played 664
              international cricket matches in total, scoring 34,357 runs.[24]
              In 2013, Tendulkar was included in an all-time Test World XI to
              mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, and he
              was the only specialist batsman of the postâ€“World War II era,
              along with Viv Richards, to get featured in the team.[25] In 2019,
              he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.[26] On 24 April
              2023, the Sydney Cricket Ground unveiled a set of gates named
              after Tendulkar and Brian Lara on the occasion of Tendulkar's 50th
              birthday and the 30th anniversary of Lara's inning of 277 at the
              ground.[27][28][29] Early life and background Tendulkar was born
              at Nirmal Nursing Home in Dadar, Bombay on 24 April 1973[30][31]
              to a Rajapur Saraswat Brahmin[better source needed] Maharastrian
              Marathi family.[32][33] His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a
              Marathi-language novelist and poet while his mother, Rajni, worked
              in the insurance industry.[34] Tendulkar's father named him after
              his favourite music director, Sachin Dev Burman.[35] Tendulkar has
              three older siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a
              half-sister Savita. They were his father's children by his first
              wife, who died after the birth of her third child.[36][37] His
              brother Ajit played in Bombay's Kanga Cricket League.[38]
              Tendulkar spent his formative years in the Sahitya Sahawas
              Cooperative Housing Society in Bandra (East). As a young boy,
              Tendulkar was considered a bully, and he often picked fights with
              new children in his school.[39] As a child, Tendulkar was
              interested in both tennis and cricket. He particularly idolised
              American player John McEnroe, and emulated his hero by growing his
              hair long at the age of 7 or 8 years. At this time, Tendulkar also
              regularly wore tennis wristbands and headbands and carried a
              tennis racquet with him as a sign of his love for
              tennis.[40][41][42] To help curb his bullying tendencies, his
              elder brother Ajit introduced Tendulkar to cricket in 1984. Ajit
              introduced him to cricket coach Ramakant Achrekar at Shivaji Park
              in Dadar. At their first meeting, Tendulkar did not play well.
              Ajit told Achrekar that he was feeling self-conscious due to the
              coach observing him, and was not displaying his natural game. Ajit
              requested the coach to give him another chance at playing, but
              watch while hiding behind a tree. This time, Tendulkar, apparently
              unobserved, played much better and was accepted at Achrekar's
              academy.[43][better source needed] Achrekar was impressed with
              Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his schooling[citation
              needed] to Sharadashram Vidyamandir School,[30] a school in Dadar
              that had produced many notable cricketers. He made his debut as a
              cricketer for Sharadashram in late 1984.[44] Prior to this,
              Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education Society's New English
              School in Bandra (East).[44] He was also coached under the
              guidance of Achrekar at Shivaji Park in the mornings and
              evenings.[45] Tendulkar would practice for hours; if he became
              exhausted, Achrekar would put a one-rupee coin on the top of the
              stumps, and the bowler who dismissed Tendulkar would get the coin.
              If Tendulkar completed the session without getting dismissed, the
              coach would give him the coin. Tendulkar considers the 13 coins he
              won among his most prized possessions.[46] While he was training
              at Shivaji Park, he moved in with his aunt and uncle, who lived
              near the park.[44] Besides school cricket, Tendulkar also played
              club cricket. In 1984, at age 11, he debuted in the Kanga Cricket
              League while playing for the John Bright Cricket Club.[44][47]
              Beginning in 1988, he played for the Cricket Club of
              India.[47][48] In 1987, at the age of 14, he attended the MRF Pace
              Foundation in Madras (now Chennai) to train as a fast bowler, but
              the trainer, Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee, was unimpressed
              and suggested that Tendulkar focus on his batting instead.[49] On
              20 January 1987, he was a substitute for Imran Khan's side in an
              exhibition match at Brabourne Stadium in Bombay.[50] A couple of
              months later, former Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar gave Tendulkar
              a pair of his own lightweight pads and told him to not get
              disheartened for not receiving the Bombay Cricket Association's
              Best Junior Cricketer Award. Of this experience, Tendulkar later
              said, "It was the greatest source of encouragement for
              me".[51][52] Tendulkar served as a ball boy in the 1987 Cricket
              World Cup when India played against England in the semifinal in
              Bombay.[53][54] In 1988, while playing for Sharadashram, Tendulkar
              and Vinod Kambli batted in an unbroken 664-run partnership in a
              Lord Harris Shield inter-school game against St. Xavier's High
              School. Tendulkar scored 326 (not out) in that match and scored
              over 1,000 runs in the tournament.[55] This was a record
              partnership in any form of cricket until 2006, when it was broken
              by two junior cricketers in Hyderabad, India.[56]
