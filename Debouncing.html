<!-- Debouncing: -->

<!-- We are going to implement debouncing, to optimizing performance of your web application.
By limiting, no of times call a function, we can achieves the performance of your webapplication. -->

<!-- sample.html -->
<!-- 
<script>
  function fnSearch() {
    console.log("fnSearch called");
  }
</script>

<input onkeyup="fnSearch()" placeholder="Search..." /> -->

<!-- In the above example, fnSearch method called for each and every keyup event. So that this method call may impact our performance.
So by using debouncing concept, we have to limit the fnSearch method calls. -->

<!-- sample.html -->

<script>
  var timer;
  function fnSearch() {
    console.log("fnSearch called");
  }

  function fnDebounce() {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(function () {
      fnSearch();
    }, 300);
  }

  <input onkeyup="fnDebounce()" placeholder="Search..." />;

  // In the above example
  // Created timer variable
  // For every keyup event fnDebounce method gets called, in this method we clear the timeout, and creates a new timeout and assigne to timer variable.
  // From settimeout callback method, we called our "fnSearch" method.
  //  Here the "fnSearch" method not called for every keyup event.
  // If the time lag between one keyup event to another keyup event grater than 300 milli seconds, then only settimeout callback method executed and it called fnSearh, otherwise settimeout gets cleared.
</script>
